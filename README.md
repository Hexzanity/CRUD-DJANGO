### Requirement:

Installation
Fork the Repository From Hexzanity github repositories

To install Django, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Django requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can check your Python version by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

python --version
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended) It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Django project. A virtual environment allows you to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

python -m venv myenv
Replace myenv with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment After creating the virtual environment, activate it by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

For Windows:

myenv\Scripts\activate

For macOS/Linux:

source myenv/bin/activate
Step 4: Install Django Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed to install Django using the package manager called pip. Run the following command:

pip install Django
This command will download and install the latest version of Django and its dependencies.

Step 5: Verify the Installation To verify that Django has been installed successfully, you can run the following command:

python -m django --version
If Django is installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed.

That's it! Django should now be installed on your system. You can start creating your Django projects and applications using the installed framework. Remember to activate your virtual environment whenever you work on a Django project.
